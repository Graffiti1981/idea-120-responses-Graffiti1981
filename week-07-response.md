I think the stuff mentioned by Briddle can very well be true in some aspects. I have a few cousins who are children and they are consistently on youtube. Sometimes, after their parents say thats enough "screen-time", they throw fits. It is almost like an addiction, and they are extremely young to be too addicted to a screen but often many times the parents prefer that then to deal with them. My Girlfriend and I have seen this in her family as well. A lot of these children are exposed to innaprpriate content from the internet and mostly from Youtube. I think the content creators are looking for one thing only ant that is money. They know that children (sometimes adults as well) are highly prone to just be entertained by "nothing". 

The solution to me personally should be that parents should monitor what their kids should watch. Parents should be more aware of what content their kids watch and for how long as well. I think there is wholesome content and maybe even beneficial videos for children and parents should research if things are set up that manner.
