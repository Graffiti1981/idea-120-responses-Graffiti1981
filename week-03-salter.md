<title>A form of gesamtkunstwerk</title>
Art can be whatever one wants it to be. Weather that may be a form of performing arts, a form of traditional fine arts, or a form of digital art. Or it can even be all combined into one. A gesamtkunstwerk is essentially defined asa mixture of various arts all rolled into one and it is a of German origin. It is a tough word to remember but it surely has impacted the world of art as we know it and it has adapted to the vocab and knowlegde of many. 
one form of gesamtkunstwerk to me can potentially be a concert. Oddly and ironically, this term was used during the beginning of modernized theatres and places to perfrom. I think a musical concert is perfect to describe this due to the great amaount of different forms of art that is intriduced to create a spectacle. Traditional artists can be busy taking part in this, digital prints for marketing and promotional services, special lighting, live music or live intrumentals that may be hidden from the audience like in the reading in order for the audeince to have their eyes on one specific performer.
