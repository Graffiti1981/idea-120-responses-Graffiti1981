For ths project I think a story about a young soccer-star prospect and his ups and downs about his career may be interesting. The story can start on natural born talent who was not funded due to economic problems. A scouting manager saw the player play at a "sunday" league and from there his career starts. Try outs begin in local MLS club then later gets sold to LigaMX Mexican League. From Mexico, a huge jump is made to Europe where soccer is very competitive, injuries and personal problems affect his career. After some recovery time the player manages to rise back up and win an important tittle for his country.
