I think murray's predictions about the internet television and inhabiting virtual environmenmts were quite accurate. Why? I think they were fairly accurate because she mentioned how as the internet grows faster, the conventions of 3D spaces can becomemore standardized.
Murray also mentioned how many platforms have taken over and have came along way from VHS and other "old-school" forms of watching media. Netflix, Youtube and Amazon have taken over with their impecible streaming era.
It is not known which platform will compete to be the most dominant platform in people's households but the prediction of Internet TV was fairly taken inplace in certain aspects.
